**Moderator  assistant in the discord of such a project as Arizona Games. This bot works on the basis of Selenium, Requests and one API that no longer works :sad: Eel is used as a graphical interface**

It is unlikely that this bot can already be used in the workforce, but it can be disassembled and studied. There are a lot of useful things in it. For example: 

 1. Regular expressions, parsing of nicknames and player fractions
 2. Hardware binding and license verification
 3. HTML+CSS+JS interface with Python backend
 4. Sending logs in telegram
 5. Auto-update and notifications in windows
 6. Saving Settings
 7. Sensitive bot setup
 8. And of course the bots themselves, who check the roles
